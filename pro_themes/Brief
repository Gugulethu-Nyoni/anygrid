Spending money or anything on someone doesn't guarantee love or loyalty. True generosity expects nothing return.

1. If you offer to take someone to dinner as an investment that should yield a relationship, congratulations—on your first attempt at entitlement and buffoonery. A date is about connection, not compensation. Also, no one asked you! 

2.Spending on people we value is a basic norm in any functional relationship—we spend on our friends, colleagues, and family without attaching wild expectations. Why should relating with someone you are even trying to court be any different? 

3.You’re clearly basic-love-and-compassion deprived. If you had friends, family, or colleagues spending on you—as it happens in any functional relationship—you’d have learned not to attach absurd expectations to something as basic as mere generosity and civility in a relationship. 

4. Your point of reference is a history of lack and a previsouly disadvantged background - While your background isn’t your fault, the way you’re now formulating relationship standards based on it absolutely is. Being previously disadvantaged is no excuse to be currently disastrous!

5. Awukaze wathandwa kahle nje wena - ulimele– (you are hurt from your past experiences) and haven't healed. Honestly, a romantic relationship at the moment - is beyond your emotional paygrade. Divest your energies into self help and personal development initiatives.
